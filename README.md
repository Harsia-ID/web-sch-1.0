# Just Project For School
This assignment asks students to create a simple website using PHP, HTML, and CSS. Students will be asked to design the main page of a website using HTML and CSS to create a layout and visual style. Apart from that, they will also add features using PHP, such as contact forms or image gallery. Through this assignment, students are expected to be able to convey basic knowledge in web development and gain an understanding of the integration between PHP, HTML, and CSS in creating websites.
